Lead Client
=======================

Lead Client is a PHP client that makes it easy to send Lead at Servicein/Cloudcare.

This library require an additional info for work, you must define three constants:
 - API_URL
 - API_KEY
 - DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN
 
 The constant value should be asked to the commercial department.

```php
define("API_URL", "**asked to the commercial department**");
define("API_KEY", "**asked to the commercial department**");
define("DEFAULT_CAMPAIGN", "**asked to the commercial department**");

$lead = new Lead();
$lead->setFirstname("Tester")
        ->setLastname("Tester")
        ->setMail("tester@test.com")
        ->setPhone("33333333333")
        ->setCity("Roma")
        ->setProvince("RM")
        ->setSex("M");
        # set other campaign 
        ->setCampaign("OTHER_CAMPAIGN") 
try{
    $leadClient = new Client($lead);
    $result = $leadClient->sendLead();
    if($result->isValid()){
        echo "Lead successfully loaded".PHP_EOL;
    }else{
        echo "Error: ".$result->message.PHP_EOL;
    }
} catch (Exception $ex) {
    echo $ex->getMessage().PHP_EOL;
}
